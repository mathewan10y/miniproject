# 🚀 U.G.F. GALACTIC OPERATIONS MANUAL
**Clearance Level:** All Ranks (Cadet to Commander)
**Status:** MANDATORY READING
**System:** Online

---

## **LEVEL 0: THE ACADEMY (LIFE SUPPORT)**
*Before you can fly the ship, you must power the ship.*

### **0.1 Power Generation (Income)**
Your ship cannot fly without a constant input of power. In the Federation, we call this **Credits**.
* **Active Core (Salary):** You trade time for energy. It's stable but stops if you stop.
* **Auxiliary Generators (Side Hustles):** Extra energy from freelance missions. Unpredictable but critical for reserves.
* **Automated Arrays (Passive Income):** Systems that generate power while you sleep (Dividends, Rent). This is the goal of every Commander.

### **0.2 Hull Breaches (Expenses)**
Every ship has leaks. Your job is to seal the dangerous ones.
* **Type A: Life Support (Needs):** Oxygen (Rent), Rations (Food). You cannot cut these, only optimize them.
* **Type B: The Void (Wants):** Fractures where energy escapes into nothingness (Netflix, Fancy Dining). If "Void" expenses > 30% of power generation, your ship will stall.

### **0.3 The Flow Gauge (Cash Flow)**
This gauge measures the pressure of your economy.
* **Formula:** `Income - Expense = Cash Flow`
* **🟢 Positive Flow:** Charging batteries (Wealth creation).
* **🔴 Negative Flow:** Draining reserves (Debt).
* **⚪ Neutral Flow:** Stagnant. One emergency (asteroid hit) will destroy you.

## **LEVEL 1: GROUND SCHOOL (THE MARKET)**
*Welcome to the Shipyard. This is where fleets are built.*

### **1.1 The Exchange (The Shipyard)**
The Stock Market is a massive, automated **Starship Dealership**.
* **Buyers & Sellers:** People trading ownership of ships.
* **The Broker:** Your interface console (the app) connecting you to the Shipyard.

### **1.2 The IPO (The Launch)**
* **Metaphor:** A new ship leaving the factory for the first time.
* **Risk:** High. The engines haven't been tested in deep space.
* **Reward:** If the launch succeeds, early buyers become rich Captains.

### **1.3 The Index (The Fleet)**
The "NIFTY 50" or "SENSEX" is the flagship fleet.
* It tracks the average speed of the top 50 biggest ships.
* **Rule:** If the Fleet is Green, the sector is safe. If Red, expect turbulence.

## **LEVEL 2: NAVIGATION (TECHNICAL ANALYSIS)**
*You cannot fly blind. You need maps. We call them Charts.*

### **2.1 Candlesticks (Star Charts)**
A "Candle" tells the story of a battle between Buyers (Bulls) and Sellers (Bears).
* **Green Candle:** Buyers won (Price went UP).
* **Red Candle:** Sellers won (Price crashed DOWN).
* **Wicks (Tails):** How far the price *tried* to go but failed.

### **2.2 Trends (Gravitational Pull)**
* **Uptrend:** The ship is climbing (Higher Highs). *Strategy: Buy.*
* **Downtrend:** The ship is falling (Lower Highs). *Strategy: Sell/Wait.*
* **Sideways:** Drifting. No clear direction. *Strategy: Do nothing.*

### **2.3 Support & Resistance (Shields)**
* **Support:** An invisible floor where the ship bounces back up.
* **Resistance:** An invisible ceiling where the ship gets hit back down.

---

## **LEVEL 3: ENGINEERING (FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS)**
*Check the engine before you buy the ship.*

### **3.1 The P/E Ratio (Fuel Efficiency)**
* **Definition:** Price-to-Earnings Ratio.
* **The Question:** "How many credits am I paying for 1 unit of power?"
* **High P/E:** Expensive luxury ship.
* **Low P/E:** Bargain junker (or a hidden gem).

### **3.2 The Balance Sheet (Cargo Manifest)**
* **Assets:** What the company *owns* (Factories, Cash). This is Armor.
* **Liabilities:** What the company *owes* (Loans). This is dead weight.
* **Rule:** If Liabilities > Assets, the ship is sinking. Eject.

---

## **LEVEL 4: HYPERDRIVE (F&O)**
*Class-S Weaponry. Expert Pilots Only.*

### **4.1 Leverage (The Afterburner)**
Leverage lets you control a massive Battleship with a tiny amount of fuel.
* **Danger:** If the ship moves 1% against you, you can lose 10% instantly.

### **4.2 Futures & Options (The Contracts)**
* **Futures:** You agree to buy a ship next month at *today's* price.
* **Call Option:** You bet the ship will go UP.
* **Put Option:** You bet the ship will go DOWN.

---

## **LEVEL 5: CRISIS MANAGEMENT (PSYCHOLOGY)**
*The enemy is not the market. It is You.*

### **5.1 Space Madness (Fear & Greed)**
* **FOMO:** Buying at the top because "everyone else is."
* **Panic Selling:** Ejecting immediately when you see Red.

### **5.2 The Stop-Loss (Auto-Eject)**
* **Rule:** A pre-programmed command to sell if the price drops. Better to lose a finger (small loss) than an arm (account blown).

### **5.3 Position Sizing (Ammo Conservation)**
* **Rule:** Never risk more than 2% of your total energy reserves on a single trade. If you are wrong, you still have 98% left to fight another day.
